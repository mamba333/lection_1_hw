### what is java script

- JS one is popular language in world and we use for more application.
And Brenden Eich created the Livescript in 1995 year.
The first time js came out, it was named mocha, and in 1996, it was renamed to live script, at that time, java was a very advanced language, so the creators of live script took the word live and put java in its place, and it got the name java script.
